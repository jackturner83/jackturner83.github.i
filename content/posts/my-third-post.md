## Stock market prediction has always been a challenging task, as it involves dealing with complex market behavior and various market conditions. However, with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential for analyzing vast amounts of data, there has been increasing interest in using AI for stock market prediction. One of the current knowledge gaps in this field is whether incorporating sentiment analysis and news data can improve the accuracy of AI models for stock market prediction. By performing sentiment analysis on news data, researchers can gain insights into the emotions and opinions of market participants, which can influence market behavior. News data can also provide valuable information that may affect stock prices, which can be captured by integrating it into the AI models. To fill this knowledge gap, researchers can follow a set of steps to investigate whether sentiment analysis and news data can improve the accuracy of AI models for stock market prediction. These steps include collecting and preprocessing historical financial data, performing sentiment analysis on news data, extracting features from the data, training and comparing different AI models, evaluating the best-performing model on a test set of data, and interpreting the results to gain insights.
