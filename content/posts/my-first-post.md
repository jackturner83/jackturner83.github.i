## Introduction

# The article that I focused on had five relevant parts. These parts include: Stock analysis, Stock prices as time-series data and related concepts, predicting stock prices with moving average techniques, intro to LSTMs(an artificial neural network used in the fields of artificial intelligence and deep learning.), and predicting stock prices with an LSTM model. This article gave me tons of insight about machine learning and the many nuances. The way the information was displayed made it much easier to understand than I previosuly thought.
