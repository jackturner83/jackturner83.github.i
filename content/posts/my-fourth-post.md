## One of the key gaps may be in my understanding of financial markets and the factors that influence stock prices. I may not have the necessary background knowledge in economics, finance, and accounting to accurately interpret the financial data I am working with. Another knowledge gap may be in my understanding of machine learning algorithms and how they can be applied to financial data. I may need to gain knowledge in regression, time series analysis, and statistical modeling techniques to effectively model and predict stock prices.
